Sign Language Detection using AI 🤖✋🔤
This project is an AI-powered sign language translator that recognizes fingerspelling-based hand gestures and converts them into text and speech. It utilizes CNNs for gesture recognition, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and OpenCV for image processing, making it suitable for real-time applications.

🚀 Features
🖐 Real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam
🔤 Supports A, B, C, D, and E alphabets (more gestures can be trained)
🔊 Text-to-Speech conversion for recognized gestures
📷 Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking
🏎 Optimized for edge AI devices like Raspberry Pi
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN-based model training)
OpenCV (for image processing)
MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
Raspberry Pi (for real-time deployment)
📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 1,200 histogram images for A, B, C, D, and E alphabets.
Preprocessed images are used for training the deep learning model.
